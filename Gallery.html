       A very bold attempt with contrasting colours. The symphony this piece creates was unexpected but highly appreciated.

      Blue and Black have been conventional colors to the sky or mostly a raging stormy sea. Both of these things can attriute to a persons emotions. This painting has used the emotions od a stry sea and the conrasting calm of midnight and poured it into a woman.

      It comes and goes in waves, it always does. We watch as our young heart fades , into the flood.
