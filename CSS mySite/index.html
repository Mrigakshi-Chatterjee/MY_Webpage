            <p class="paint-para">I started painting form a very young age because i have always wanted to create something new.The clock strikes midnight, and I dip my brush into a dab of acrylic blue, adding color to my otherwise featureless sky. Dragging it across the canvas, leading down to the house on the horizon. My canvas is already filled with a sketch and now all I need to do is add color and shades to give it dimension.</p>

              I have a strong sense of needing to acknowledge and indeed worship my Creator, but no longer in the framework of any organized religion. The works of Creation are all around us, and to my eye they are beautiful. To fit them into the frame of my cameraâ€™s viewfinder and make the exposure is for me an affirmation of their beauty and this affirmation is indeed an act of worship.
